VRNeckSafer tries to help to help virtual pilots flying in VR to not break their neck while trying to check their six.
It adds an angular offset to the current viewing angle by pressing a joystick button. Currently working with IL2 with SteamVR.

**How to use it:**

Simply choose the Joystick/HOTAS and the two buttons you want to use for left and right offset and the required rotation angle.
Thats it. It works with normal SteamVR (no Beta required).

If you prefer adding up the offset angle with every button click, select the "Accumulative" option.

If you want to move your head position a few centimeters when using snap view (e.g. to look around your seat) use the Translation feature.
For this to work properly you have to (re)set your neutral head angle (HMD yaw) once, so that the app knows which direction "L/R" and "Fwd" are.
 
Also, as an experimental feature, there is an "Autorotate" setting that can be enabled. Here the Offset angle is automatically activated when turning your head over a defined activation angle and deactivated when below a deactivation angle. No joystick buttons required. :) But don't forget to reset HMD yaw once!

**Update v1.1:**

I added the option to use a joystick button to reset the HMD Yaw angle. To use the autorotate feature look straight ahead and press that button (or the reset button in the GUI). This will tell the app from which central Yaw position the activation/deactivation angles are measured.  

**Update v1.2:**

I included a feature to define translational offsets. Better use only a few centimeters here and reset HMD yaw...
Still some  AV checker might give false alerts, haven't got an idea how to avoid that.  

**Update v1.3:**

Minor bugfix when no button was selected and a beautiful new icon! ;)

**Update v1.4:**

Added an option to use diagonal Hat positions.
To use it:
-     run VRNeckSafer v1.4 once to update the VRNeckSafer.cfg file
-     exit VRNeckSafer v1.4
-     open VRNeckSafer.cfg in a text editor
-     at the line "Use8WayHat" change false to true
-     safe and exit editor
